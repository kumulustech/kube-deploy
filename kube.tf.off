# For OpenStack, as with Digital Ocean, access credentials are needed
# They can be provided in a fashion similar to DO, passed as variables
# or via the terraform CLI as parameters, but they also can be passed
# as environment variables.  The standard "openrc.sh" file includes
# all the prerequisite parameters including OS_AUTH_URL, OS_PASSWORD
# OS_USERNAME, OS_TENANT_NAME, and OS_REGION_NAME.  The simplest is
# often to source the openrc file to set these variables, or set them
# in the provdier as follows:

#provider "openstack" {
#    user_name  = "admin"
#    tenant_name = "admin"
#    password  = "pwd"
#    auth_url  = "http://myauthurl:5000/v2.0"
#}

#   name = "ruby-os.opsits.com"

#   flavor_id = "3"
#   key_pair = "rhs"

#      command = "echo ${openstack_compute_instance_v2.ruby-os.access_ip_v4} ansible_connection=ssh ansible_ssh_user=root >> inventory"
#    }
# }

# Designate is not currently supported, so this example leverages the
# Digital Ocean DNS service from the other example to provide DNS
# support.  Note that this is one of the values of Terraform, the ability
# to leverage multiple services as desired.
